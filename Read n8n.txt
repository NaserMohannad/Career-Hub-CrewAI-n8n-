🧠 n8n Workflows – Automated Data & Notification System

This folder contains five n8n automation workflows that together manage the full data pipeline — from fetching raw opportunities to sending them automatically to students through email and Slack.
All workflows are fully automated, deployed on n8n Cloud, and integrate with Hugging Face Spaces, Slack, Gmail, and external APIs for smooth end-to-end operation.

⚙️ Workflow 1: send data.json

Schedule: Runs automatically every 24 hours (midnight).

Purpose

Responsible for:

Fetching the latest registered users (students) data from the database.

Processing, cleaning, and structuring their profiles and preferences (skills, interests, job goals, etc.).

Sending the prepared dataset via HTTP POST requests to the Search Agents on Hugging Face for personalized job and opportunity matching.

Key Features

Automated daily scheduling using the Cron node.

Code nodes for flexible data transformation and validation of student profiles.

n8n Data Store integration for caching and backup of processed student data.

Secure HTTP Request communication with Hugging Face APIs and external AI agents.

📧 Workflow 2: get data.json

Trigger: Activated when Search Agents on Hugging Face return processed results.

Purpose

Receives search results and sends them directly to each registered student via Gmail.

Key Features

Webhook node to receive POST data in real-time.

Parses and formats JSON payloads into structured job summaries.

Sends professional HTML-formatted emails using the Gmail node.

Automatically maps each result to the right student based on their interests and email address.

🧩 Workflow 3: career guide.json

Type: Multi-Agent Orchestrator System
Integration: Connected to the UI hosted on GitHub servers via Webhook.

Purpose

An AI-powered career guidance system that helps students reach their professional goals by:

Evaluating and improving their Resume.

Optimizing their LinkedIn profile.

Preparing them for interviews using dynamic agent feedback.

Architecture

Composed of approximately 12 specialized agents (Resume Evaluator, LinkedIn Optimizer, Interview Coach, Feedback Refiner, etc.).

Powered by Perplexity, Gemini, and Cohere as LLM providers.

Integrates with the GitHub-hosted UI via Webhook for real-time student interaction.

Key Features

Multi-agent reasoning pipeline for coordinated results.

JSON-based deterministic communication between agents.

Automatic feedback loop to refine guidance.

Smooth, real-time UI integration.

🌐 Workflow 4: fetch.json

Schedule: Runs automatically every 24 hours.

Purpose

Monitors multiple LinkedIn and Instagram pages to detect new posts in the last 24 hours, classifies them, and stores relevant ones in the database for later use.

Process Overview

Scraping Phase: Extracts posts using scrapers or APIs.

Classification Phase: Determines whether the post is about a job, training, workshop, or event.

Database Update: Stores filtered and structured posts for future workflows.

Automation: Runs automatically once per day.

Key Features

AI-based post classification and filtering.

Integration with social media scrapers.

Data storage synchronization with the central database.

💬 Workflow 5: ToSlack.json

Schedule: Triggered automatically after fetch.json completes or runs periodically (optional Cron schedule).

Purpose

Fetches the processed and classified posts from the database (generated by fetch.json) and sends them directly to a designated Slack channel, making sure students are instantly notified of the latest opportunities.

Key Features

Connects to the central database to retrieve new opportunities.

Uses Slack node to send formatted, structured messages to a dedicated channel.

Supports Markdown formatting and emoji for better readability.

Ensures only new or unposted opportunities are sent (avoids duplication).

Keeps students continuously updated with relevant internships, workshops, and job posts.
